## HackernewsApp
I have tried out Progressive Web App features offered by Angular in this app. I have used [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) to audit against features for PWA app. 

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
